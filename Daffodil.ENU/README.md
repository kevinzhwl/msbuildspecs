msbuildspecs--Daffodil
============
Daffodil provides native multi-targeting platform toolsets for Visual Studio 2010 C++ developers who need to target older versions of Visual Studio.

To use these platform toolsets, you must have the targeted version of Visual Studio installed. Currently supported platforms are:
- Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8) win32/x64
- Visual Studio 2003 (VC 7.1)
- Visual Studio 2002 (VC 7)
- Visual Studio 6 (VC 6)

Visual Studio 2012
Daffodil is not supported or tested in VS 2012, however it does appear to work in VS 2012 as long as VS 2010 is also installed.
